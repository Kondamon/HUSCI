# Human Survival Climatic Scale (HUSCI)

> Note: This is a draft that is work in progress.

The Human Survival Climatic Scale (HUSCI) is a tool designed to categorize and communicate the impacts of climate change on human life. It assesses factors like extreme weather frequency, necessary relocations, climate-induced health issues, and rising sea levels. HUSCI's structured approach, akin to the Beaufort Wind Scale, makes complex climate data more accessible and understandable, aiding scientists and policymakers in conveying urgent climate challenges and fostering informed decision-making. This scale aims to replace abstract temperature targets with a clearer, more relatable system for public and stakeholder engagement.

## Introduction

Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges of our time, impacting ecosystems, economies, and societies. Understanding its effects, however, can be daunting due to the complexity of scientific data involved. The Human Survival Climatic (HUSCI) Scale is developed to bridge this gap, offering a comprehensible and robust framework to communicate the impact of climate change effects on earth and humans.

## Background and Problem Statement
The challenge of communicating complex scientific data in a manner that is accessible and tangible to the general public has long been recognized across various scientific disciplines. A notable example in this context is the use of scales to simplify complex phenomena. The Beaufort Scale, for instance, translates wind speeds into terms that are easily understandable by non-experts. Similarly, the HUSCI aims to encapsulate the multifaceted effects of climate change into a more digestible format.

### The Challenge with Communicating in Degrees ###

When discussing climate change, the use of average temperature increases, often expressed in degrees Celsius, has been a standard. However, this method of communication has its limitations, particularly in conveying the severity and real-world implications of climate change to the general public. For instance, hearing about a "3-degree increase" might not sound alarming to many, as it seems minor in the context of daily weather fluctuations.

#### Misunderstanding the Impact ####

The problem lies in the underestimation of what these degrees actually represent. A global average temperature rise of even a few degrees can have catastrophic effects:

1. ***Ecosystem Disruption:*** Small increases can lead to significant changes in weather patterns, affecting ecosystems and biodiversity.
2. ***Extreme Weather Events:*** Higher averages are linked to more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods.
3. ***Long-Term Changes:*** These temperature changes can lead to long-term shifts in climate zones, affecting agriculture, water resources, and human habitability.

### The Need for a More Intuitive Approach ###

Given these challenges, there's a growing recognition of the need for more intuitive and impactful ways to communicate climate change. This is where tools like the Human Survival Climatic Scale (HUSCI) come in. HUSCI translates complex climatic data, including temperature changes, into a more relatable and understandable format. It focuses on the direct impact on human survival and well-being, making the abstract concept of climate change more tangible and immediate.

### Methodology

The HUSCI is derived from a comprehensive analysis of climatic variables, such as temperature extremes, precipitation patterns, and frequency of natural disasters. It also incorporates socio-economic factors like healthcare availability, local adaptation strategies, and community resilience. This multidimensional approach ensures that the scale reflects both the environmental and human aspects of climate change.

### Applications

The HUSCI serves multiple purposes:

1. **Public Awareness:** By simplifying complex data, HUSCI helps in raising public awareness about the urgency of tackling climate change.
2. **Policy Making:** It provides policymakers with a clear indicator of climate change's human impact, guiding more effective climate policies.
3. **Research Tool:** For researchers, HUSCI offers a standardized metric to assess and compare the impact of climate change across different regions and time periods.

## The Scale

The Human Survival Climatic Scale (HUSCI), while a significant step forward in communicating climate change's human impact, is an evolving framework and work in progress.
